# AATP Roadmap

**Current phase: v0.x — Founder Stewardship**

This roadmap describes the planned development of AATP's reference implementation and supporting tools. The Conceptual Framework (v0.45 — descriptive; v0.44 retained as snapshot) and Governance Addendum (v0.21) are complete and stable. v0.45 accepts an optional Profile layer — ACP, LAEP, a Finance sketch (in `docs/profiles/`) and a non-normative Operating-Cost report — distilled from the first landing application and folded upstream; no Core Invariant changed. What follows is the path from specification to working code.

AATP follows a "can run before can promote" philosophy: no public outreach until there is executable code that anyone can clone, run, and see results from.

## ✅ Completed

- Conceptual Framework v0.44
- Governance Addendum v0.21
- Architecture diagrams (5 Mermaid diagrams covering all three modes + implementation architecture)
- GitHub repository and documentation

## 🔨 In Progress: Core SDK (`aatp_core`)

The Python reference implementation. All code in this package is deterministic — zero LLM dependencies.

**Modules:**

| Module | Purpose | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `record.py` | Pydantic data model for audit records | In progress |
| `canonical.py` | RFC 8785 JSON canonicalization (via existing library) | In progress |
| `crypto.py` | Ed25519 key management, SHA-256 hashing, record signing | In progress |
| `chain.py` | Hash chain construction, integrity verification | In progress |
| `session.py` | Session lifecycle orchestration (start → record → end) | In progress |
| `storage.py` | Local storage backend (JSON files, abstractable) | In progress |
| `verifier.py` | Level 1 + Level 2 automated verification | In progress |

**Key deliverables:**

- JSON Schema for audit record validation (auto-generated from Pydantic model)
- Golden file: a known-correct audit record with pre-computed hashes for cross-implementation testing
- Technical Specification v0.1 (living draft, maintained alongside code)
- **Spec v0.1 Freeze:** once the SDK API stabilizes, the Technical Specification will be frozen for external consumption. No structural changes after this point without a formal RFC.

## 🔜 Next: Demos

### Solo Mode Demo

A personal AI agent managing subscriptions and finances, generating auditable decision records. Runs entirely offline with mock data — no API keys required.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mrooxx/aatp-protocol.git
cd aatp-protocol
pip install -e .
python examples/demo_solo.py
```

### Bilateral Mode Demo + Tamper Detection

Two agents transacting with cross-referenced audit trails. Includes a tamper detection demo showing what happens when a record is modified after creation — with diff output showing exactly what was changed.

### CLI Tool

Human-readable viewer for audit trails:

```bash
python -m tools.aatp_cli view examples/output/trail.json
```

## 📋 Planned: Real Agent Integration

- Connect `aatp_core` to a real LLM agent (Claude, GPT, or local model)
- Demonstrate Level 3 reasonableness review by an independent audit AI
- Evaluate integration with personal AI server platforms (OpenClaw, Home Assistant AI)

## 🔮 Future

- ~~Merkle tree anchoring — scope and mandatory status to be determined based on implementation experience.~~ **Addressed in v0.45 by the LAEP profile** (`docs/profiles/AATP-LAEP-Profile-v0.1.md`): anchoring is optional in v0.x and carrier-neutral; the anchored records form their own sealed chain; proven on a public testnet (LAEP §11). Merkle *batching* at scale is specified (LAEP §5.3) but not yet run end-to-end.
- Threat model document — formal analysis of replay attacks, key rotation, storage corruption, clock manipulation, and other protocol-level security concerns
- `pip install aatp` — PyPI package (after API stabilization)
- MCP Tool Server — wrap Recorder and Reviewer as standard MCP tools
- Conformance test suite for third-party implementations
- Community outreach (Show HN, personal AI server communities, AAIF)
- Submission to a standards body (AAIF, IETF, or W3C) — after 3+ independent implementations and a completed conformance test suite

## Design Constraints

These constraints apply throughout development:

1. **Zero LLM dependency in the SDK.** `aatp_core` is entirely deterministic. LLMs participate only at the agent layer and audit layer, never in record creation or verification. (Principle 6: Deterministic Security, Probabilistic Intelligence)

2. **Zero external dependency for demos.** `git clone → pip install -e . → python run` must work without API keys, network access, or external services.

3. **Documentation is frozen unless formal RFC accepted.** The Conceptual Framework and Governance Addendum are stable. Changes require a documented RFC with public rationale, consistent with the governance process defined in the Addendum.

*This roadmap is a living document. Progress updates will be reflected here as milestones are reached.*
